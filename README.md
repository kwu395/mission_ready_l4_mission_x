# Mission Background üéì

‚ÄúLevelUp Works‚Äù is a company that provides education technologies to primary and intermediate schools in New Zealand.  It is currently in the process of improving its educational technology platform, and a new application design 
has been created as a result. The aim of the application is to provide a Learning Management System (LMS) for school teachers to deliver the Digital Technologies curriculum (specifically, to deliver classes to learn programming) 
in an easy way. It is designed so that classes can be conducted either in person or online, although there is no video component included in the application.
